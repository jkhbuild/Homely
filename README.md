# Welcome to Homely

[Click Here](https://homely.onrender.com) for the live site.

## Introduction

Homely is a clone of Apartments.com. Apartments.com is a tool for renters and property owners to view and display
rental properties. A property owner/manager can list multiple properties, and renters could view, review, and favorite
potential homes. As a former construction real estate professional, I wanted to build out a rental platform that
mimiced the design of Apartments.com. The technologies used to build this project include:

- Languages: Javascript, Ruby on Rails, HTML, and CSS.
- Frontend: React-Redux
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Hosting: Render
- Asset Storage: AWS S3
- Misc: Google Maps API

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.
